# Narcotic Crimes in Chicago
The City of Chicago maintains a database of all criminal reports filed by their police department. These include cases in which no arrest was made, and extend from the lightest criminal charges up to and including homicide.

I collected narcotic-related crime reports across 2012 per Census block group. Within each block group, there are variables from the 2010 US Census and the 2011 American Community Survey that provide additional information. The counts of narcotic-related crimes are split in two: cannabis and non-cannabis related cases. The goal is to understand how demographic and geographic factors relate to narcotic-related crime in Chicago. (1) Does narcotic-related crimes depend on demographic and geographic factors? (2) Moreover, are cannabis and noncannabis-related crimes correlated?

The following project goes through the following sections:</br>
(1) Exploratory Data Analysis</br> 
(2) Initial Modeling</br>
(3) Diagnostics</br>
(4) Reults</br>
(5) Conclusion</br>
